													In the recent scams involving OCBC Bank, fraudsters sent SMS messages claiming to be from the bank to trick its customers.
													Some scammers have made use of the same sender identification labels used by the legitimate banks when sending fake SMS messages.
													For example, some of the SMS messages sent to OCBC customers seemed to have been sent by "OCBC" and appeared in the same message thread as previous genuine messages.
													The messages often claim there is a problem with the recipient's bank account that needs to be resolved urgently, and include a link to a fake website that resembles the real one.
													Victims who enter their log-in information and one-time passwords (OTP) on the fake website can quickly have their accounts breached and their savings stolen.
													<br><br>
													phishing emails, smishing texts are social-engineering scams that aim to manipulate people 
													into turning over sensitive data such as Social Security numbers, credit card numbers and 
													account passwords or providing access to a business's computer system. They rely on 
													persuading you that the sender is a familiar or trusted source and that urgent action is 
													needed to secure a benefit, resolve a problem or avert a threat.
