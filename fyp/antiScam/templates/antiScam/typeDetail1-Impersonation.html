													One type of phishing scam involves crooks posing as authority figures such as the police,
													job recruiters or government officials. Using SMS messages, e-mails or phone calls, they try
													to convince potential victims to part with money or give up sensitive information such as 
													banking log-in details or personal data such as NRIC numbers. A variant involves fake bank 
													hotline numbers being listed on Google search results. Victims who call these numbers will 
													be connected to scammers pretending to be bank staff. Common tactics involve claiming the 
													recipient has got into legal trouble, or offering simple yet well-paid part-time jobs and
													investment schemes with high interest rates. Victims who respond are asked to pay fees or
													provide personal information. <br> <br>
													The police, the Supreme Court and the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board recently warned 
													the public of such scams. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic,
													many scammers also pretended to be calling from the Health Ministry and claimed they were
													requesting information for contact tracing purposes. They often mask the caller ID number 
													to appear as a local number starting with the Singapore country code "+65", even though they may be calling
													from overseas. Scammers may also pose as one's contacts. E-mail addresses, for example, can be 
													spoofed to appear as if the message was sent by a colleague or friend requesting money for urgent personal needs.

												<div id="SafeInfo" style="display: none;">
													<h3>Look out for '+' numbers</h3>
													<p>Don't pick up calls from these numbers unless you're expecting an overseas call.</p>
													<h3>Don't give anyone confidential information</h3>
													<p>Do not disclose your personal details to anyone without verification. Never share confidential information such as account passwords, OTPs with anyone. Banks and government officials will never ask you for bank transfers, personal details, bank account and credit card details, or OTPs over the phone.</p>
													<h3>Identify and verify</h3>
													<p>Hang up immediately if the caller cannot identify themselves properly. Always verify the authenticity of the information or request through official websites, apps, email or call the company's hotline.</p>
													<h3>Don't take susoicious links</h3>
													<p>Do not click on URLs in unsolicited emails or text messages.</p>
													<h3>Stay calm</h3>
													<p>Do not act on requests for sensitive and personal information without verification, especially if the request is made out of the blue. If in doubt, ask someone you trust for a second opinion.</p>
