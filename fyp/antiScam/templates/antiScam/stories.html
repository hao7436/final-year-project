												<h3>CALL FROM "BANK" TURNED OUT TO BE A FAKE</h3>
												<p>
													The call came to my daughter from ICBC China Bank, from their Chinatown branch.
													The person was able to address my daughter by her name and informed her that
													her I/C was used to issue a credit card which was sent to an address in Bukit Timah.
													There was a payment of almost $10,000 due tomorrow. She started to panic and at that
													point, she was transferred to a 'police officer'. At that point, she came to me And
													gave me the phone and i spoke to that 'officer'. Initially, there were no red flags
													and the policeman I spoke to spoke English with a Singaporean accent and sounded
													genuine. He asked me to come down to the cantonment branch to make a report and
													when i asked if i can make a report in my neighbourhood police post, he agreed.
													After the call, when i spoke to my daughter, i realised it was a +65 number and
													so could be a spam call. I called the bank and asked them to check if a
													credit card was issued since we had the card number and they said no. I also
													called the spoofed number and the person who picked up said he was not from the bank.
													Please be careful as this seems to be a new type of scam and the people speaking don't speak with obvious
													accents, so it sounded like a very genuine call.
