													You are befriended by an attractive person (usually foreign) online and after gaining your trust, they 
													ask you for money as proof of love. He/She will tell a tale about falling into trouble or hard times and ask for 
													a loan from you. Once the money is transferred, the scammer disappears.
													In some cases, your online friend may ask you to invest in a company or cryptocurrencies.
													He/she may also request that you help them receive or transfer funds on their behalf using your bank account.
													<br> <br>
													Posing as attractive potential partners, scammers usually target vulnerable victims on dating and social media platforms, often using stolen photos on their profiles.
													After befriending the victims and gaining their trust, the scammers spin a tale about falling on hard times and ask for money.
													They may also demand gifts or money as proof of the victim's love, or claim they need the money to arrange a visit to the victim's country.
													Another common ruse is for scammers to invite their smitten victims to buy into fake investment schemes or business ventures.
