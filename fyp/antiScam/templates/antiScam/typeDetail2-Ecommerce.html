													Scams involving fake item listings often take place on e-commerce marketplaces, auction sites or trading features on social media platforms.
													The most common type involves listing high-demand items such as gaming consoles or concert tickets for unusually low prices, which tempts users who are looking for a bargain.
													Once payment has been made, the "seller" disappears or becomes unresponsive, and the would-be buyer never receives the promised item.
													Some scammers claim to be offering "pre-orders" that will take some time to arrive in Singapore, which can cause victims to delay making a complaint or report.
													Another related scam involves unsolicited SMS messages or e-mails claiming the recipient's parcel is stuck in transit and that a fee must be paid to ensure delivery. Victims sometimes fall for such claims even if they had not ordered any item.

													E-commerce scams usually involve fake online sales listings for expensive or in-demand items. In a recent case,
													a 28-year-old woman listed a Rolex watch for sale on Carousell and became uncontactable once the buyer made a
													$5,000 bank transfer to her account. Such listings often boast unusually low prices or make extravagant claims 
													about the products, such as test kits that are able to diagnose COVID-19 in 10 minutes.

													<h3>Use reliable platforms </h3>
													<p>Stick to making purchases from online platforms that have an in-built function that only releases payment to the seller once the item has been received.</p>
													<h3>Be wary of products</h3>
													<p>if an itemâ€™s price looks too good to be true, it is probably a fake.</p>
